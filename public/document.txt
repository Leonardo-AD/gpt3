Setup our repository gpt3: 
    
    npx create-react-app ./

    install the extension: ES7+ React/Redux/React-Native snippets
    (with that extension we can use the comand rafce and construct react functional Component.)

    npm install react-icons
    (in this project we'll use react skills only)

    creating the folder 'components' with folders: article, brand, cta, feature and navbar
    export files on this folders at index.js in the folder 'components' 
    
    creating the folder 'containers' with folders: blog, features, footer, header, possibility and whatGPT3
    export files on this folders at index.js in the folder 'containers'

    in App.js we can import all files that we need: 
        import { Blog, Features, Footer, Header, Possibility, WhatGPT3 } from './containers'
        import { Brand, CTA, Navbar } from './components'   
    that way we keep it simple and clean.
    now we can construct the application calling ours interfaces. 

    at folder 'src' we have the 'App.css' where i'm setting general css's rules 
    at folder 'src' we have the 'index.css' in that file we setup a font style and colors as variable
    to use on 'App.css'

    in the site 'angrytools.com/gradient/' we generate the gradient to the application

    setting up 'react-dom' at 'src > index.js' a new version 18 of React: 
        import { createRoot } from 'react-dom/client';
        const container = document.getElementById('root');
        const root = createRoot(container); // createRoot(container!) if you use TypeScript
        root.render(<App tab="home" />);
